Here is the English translation of what you typed, kept in the same style:

1. I have a structure with 3 layers: core, distribution, and access.

2. I have created VLANs 192.168.10.0 and 192.168.20.0.

3. I need to connect the distribution layer switches to the core layer switch.

4. I have to set up trunk links and assign VLANs between switches.

5. I need to configure a Layer 3 switch to enable inter-VLAN routing.

6. I must check whether the structure is correct using simulation mode.
